## Hi Thereüëã
Hello! My name is Wahyu Werayana, I'm a beginner and passionate game programmer using Unity Engine. Currently an active student at Binus University, majoring in B26 Game Application and Technology. Being an avid gamer with a passion for gaming inspired me to pursue this particular field of study. Has a curiosity beyond just playing games and deeply interested in understanding the mechanics behind the creation and development of games.
